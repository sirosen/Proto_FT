\section{Overview}

We are interested in converting an arbitrary nesting of arrays and tuples into a single flattened array, which is comprised of nested tuples containing arrays of non-tuple, non-array values paired with a shape parameter.
One of our key insights in our attempts to produce a complete implementation of flattening on a toy IR which only supports pairs, rather than n-tuples, is that there is an information preserving transformation on arrays that moves tuples from the inside out, and that all nestings of arrays and tuples can be operated for projections and subscripts by a single hybrid operator, $\Phi$.
